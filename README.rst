Portier Relying Party demo code
===============================

This is a minimal Python implementation of a Portier Relying Party. It is
implemented in Python 3 and requires the `cryptography`_ library to be
installed. Run it simply with `./server.py` (runs on port 8000 by default).

The primary use of this implementation is testing the `broker`_ code.
